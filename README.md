# rust-path-tracer

Simple path tracer with OpenGL visualization. Nothing fancy, it's an educational project to help me learn **Rust** programming langugage. You can navigate through the scene with WSAD and mouse (OpenGL rendering) and when you stop the scene will start to render using multi-threaded path tracer.

Features:
 - Multi-threaded
 - Real-time visualization using OpenGL
 - Importance sampling
 - Camera configuration
